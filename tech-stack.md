## Rationale for Technology Choices

### Why Supabase?
Supabase provides a complete backend solution combining PostgreSQL, authentication, and real-time capabilities. It significantly reduces development time while maintaining flexibility and security. The PostgreSQL foundation ensures enterprise-grade reliability for the credit system.

### Why AWS?
AWS offers comprehensive cloud services with excellent scaling capabilities, crucial for handling variable call volumes. The serverless architecture (Lambda + API Gateway) minimizes operational costs while providing high availability.

### Why GPT-4o-mini?
GPT-4o-mini provides advanced content moderation capabilities at a reasonable cost and performance profile. It's ideal for scanning call prompts for policy violations before processing them.

### Why Google Sheets for Logging?
Google Sheets provides a familiar interface for non-technical users to access logs and reports. It's easily accessible, shareable, and can be automated with the Google Sheets API. This makes it ideal for quick reporting and auditing of call activity.

### Why Stripe?
Stripe offers a comprehensive payment platform with excellent developer experience. Their credit system management, invoicing, and subscription capabilities align perfectly with the MCP wrapper's billing requirements.

## Scaling Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: AWS Lambda automatically scales based on demand
- **Database Scaling**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) can scale with read replicas
- **Caching**: Redis or AWS ElastiCache for improved performance
- **Queue Management**: SQS for handling high-volume webhook processing
