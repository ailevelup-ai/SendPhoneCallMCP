## Next Steps

1. Resolve AWS CLI binary execution issue
2. Create API Gateway using the create-api-gateway.js script
3. Complete the staging deployment
4. Conduct thorough testing in the staging environment
5. Once validated, deploy to production
6. Monitor the production deployment and ensure all services are functioning correctly

## Recent Updates

- Created environment-specific configuration files (.env.staging, .env.production)
- Implemented centralized Lambda handler approach with index.js
- Created Lambda wrapper utility for consistent error handling
- Developed environment verification script (check-environment.js)
- Created API Gateway creation script (create-api-gateway.js)
- Fixed Lambda handler update script syntax error
- Created comprehensive deployment issues documentation

## Deployment & Monitoring Tools

In addition to the core service components, we've developed several specialized deployment and debugging tools to ensure smooth operation:

### Enhanced Deployment and Monitoring

‚úÖ **Shell-based API Gateway Creation** - A robust shell script (`create-api-gateway-shell.sh`) that handles API Gateway creation reliably without Node.js dependencies

‚úÖ **Improved Staging Deployment** - Enhanced staging deployment script (`deploy-to-staging.sh`) with better error handling and resource validation

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Deployment Monitoring** - Deployment monitoring script (`deployment-monitor.sh`) that provides detailed validation of all deployed resources

‚úÖ **Production Deployment with Advanced Debugging** - Enhanced production deployment script (`deploy-to-production-with-debugging.sh`) with extensive logging, AWS CLI tracing, and automatic issue detection

‚úÖ **Deployment Troubleshooting Toolkit** - Specialized troubleshooting script (`troubleshoot-deployment.sh`) with targeted diagnostics for Lambda and API Gateway issues

These tools provide a robust framework for:
- Detecting and fixing deployment issues automatically
- Generating comprehensive logs for troubleshooting
- Creating deployment reports with actionable recommendations
- Validating all infrastructure components after deployment
- Ensuring consistent environment configurations

The tools have already been used to identify and fix several issues related to Lambda handler configuration and API Gateway permissions.
