## Conclusion

The MCP ecosystem continues to grow rapidly, with new directories and servers appearing regularly. When listing your MCP server, consider submitting to multiple directories to increase visibility. The most established directories appear to be MCP.so, Claude's official directory, Glama.ai, and the GitHub repositories, while specialized platforms provide targeted exposure to specific communities.

For server developers, publishing your MCP implementation to package managers like npm or PyPI is recommended, as this practice is favored by quality-focused directories and makes installation easier for end users. As the ecosystem evolves, we can expect more sophisticated discovery mechanisms like the proposed `.well-known/mcp` standard to emerge, further streamlining the process of connecting MCP clients and servers.
