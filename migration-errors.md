# AilevelUp Phone Call MCP - Migration Issues Tracker

This document tracks current issues encountered during the migration of the AilevelUp Phone Call MCP service to AWS.

## Active Issues

### Critical Issues

#### AWS CLI Binary Execution Issue

**Description**: The AWS CLI binary at `/usr/local/bin/aws` cannot be executed, causing all AWS commands to fail.

**Error Message**:
```
/usr/local/bin/aws: cannot execute binary file
```

**Impact**: 
- Cannot deploy the API Gateway
- Cannot complete the deployment process to staging environment
- Cannot run AWS CLI commands for management and verification

**Attempted Solutions**:
- Verified AWS CLI is installed at `/usr/local/bin/aws`
- Created environment verification script to diagnose issues

**Next Steps**:
1. Reinstall AWS CLI using the appropriate installer for macOS arm64 architecture
2. Verify installation with `aws --version`
3. Configure AWS credentials with `aws configure`
4. Run environment verification script again to confirm resolution

#### API Gateway Creation Pending

**Description**: The API Gateway for the staging environment has not been created due to AWS CLI issues.

**Impact**:
- Lambda functions cannot be accessed via API endpoints
- Cannot complete end-to-end testing of the service
- Deployment to staging environment is incomplete

**Next Steps**:
1. After resolving AWS CLI issue, run `node create-api-gateway.js staging us-east-1`
2. Verify API Gateway creation and routing setup
3. Update Lambda permissions for API Gateway invocation
4. Test API endpoints using the test suite

### Non-Critical Issues

#### Lambda Function Handler Syntax Error

**Description**: The Lambda handler update script contained a syntax error (missing closing parenthesis).

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution**:
- Fixed the syntax error in `tools/update-lambda-handlers.js` by adding the missing closing parenthesis
- Created a centralized `index.js` file in the functions directory to handle all Lambda function invocations

#### Environment-Specific Configuration Needed

**Description**: Environment-specific configuration files are needed for proper deployment.

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution**:
- Created `.env.staging` and `.env.production` configuration files with environment-specific settings
- Added appropriate environment variables for all service components
- Updated deployment scripts to use the environment-specific files

## Recently Resolved Issues

### Lambda Function Handler Approach

**Issue**: Lambda functions were using individual handler files, leading to module resolution issues.

**Resolution**: 
- Implemented a centralized handler approach using `functions/index.js`
- Created a Lambda wrapper utility for consistent error handling
- All Lambda functions now use the centralized handler approach

### Deployment Script Consistency

**Issue**: Deployment scripts were inconsistent and had multiple entry points.

**Resolution**:
- Created comprehensive deployment scripts for staging and production environments
- Added environment verification script to diagnose deployment issues
- Created API Gateway creation script for consistent setup
- All scripts follow a consistent pattern and error handling approach

## Verification Steps

After resolving the AWS CLI binary execution issue:

1. Run environment verification:
   ```bash
   node check-environment.js staging us-east-1
   ```

2. Create the API Gateway:
   ```bash
   node create-api-gateway.js staging us-east-1
   ```

3. Deploy to staging:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-to-staging.sh
   ```

4. Verify deployment:
   ```bash
   # Check Lambda functions
   aws lambda list-functions --region us-east-1 --query "Functions[?starts_with(FunctionName, 'ailevelup-phone-call-mcp-staging')]"

   # Check API Gateway
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis --region us-east-1 --query "items[?name=='ailevelup-phone-call-mcp-staging-api']"
   
   # Run API tests
   node tests/run-api-tests.js --config staging
   ```

## Recent Troubleshooting Steps

1. Created environment verification script to diagnose deployment issues:
   - Checked AWS CLI installation and credentials
   - Verified environment files and deployment scripts
   - Checked API Gateway and Lambda function status

2. Created deployment issues documentation with solutions for current problems:
   - AWS CLI binary execution issue
   - API Gateway creation process
   - Lambda function handler approach

3. Implemented centralized handler approach in `functions/index.js`:
   - Created wrapper for consistent error handling
   - Unified all Lambda function exports in one file
   - Added better error handling and CORS support

4. Verified environment-specific configurations:
   - Created `.env.staging` and `.env.production` files
   - Added appropriate environment variables for all components 

## Recent Updates

### Enhanced Deployment Process (Added on 2025-03-14)

To address the deployment issues encountered during the migration, we've developed and implemented a comprehensive set of deployment tools:

1. **Shell-based API Gateway Creation**: Implemented a robust shell script that uses AWS CLI directly, bypassing the Node.js AWS SDK interaction issues. This ensures reliable API Gateway creation even when there are issues with Node.js execSync.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring and Diagnostics**: Created specialized tools that provide:
   - Real-time deployment monitoring with detailed logs
   - Automatic issue detection and remediation
   - Comprehensive deployment reports
   - Targeted troubleshooting for specific AWS components

3. **Improved Error Handling**: All deployment scripts now include:
   - Detailed error capture and logging
   - Automatic detection of common Lambda and API Gateway issues
   - Step-by-step validation of all deployment components

4. **AWS CLI Tracing**: Implemented an AWS CLI wrapping mechanism that captures all AWS CLI commands, their outputs, and exit codes for detailed debugging.

These enhancements have significantly improved our ability to identify and resolve deployment issues quickly. The tools auto-detect and can fix common problems like incorrect Lambda handler configurations and missing API Gateway permissions.

Documentation for these new tools has been added in `deployment-tools-README.md`.

### Next Steps

The following steps are recommended to complete the migration:

1. Run the enhanced deployment process to staging using:
   ```
   ./deploy-to-staging.sh
   ```

2. Validate the staging deployment with the monitoring tool:
   ```
   ./deployment-monitor.sh staging
   ```

3. If issues are found, use the targeted troubleshooting tool:
   ```
   ./troubleshoot-deployment.sh staging
   ```

4. Once staging is verified, deploy to production using the enhanced debugging script:
   ```
   ./deploy-to-production-with-debugging.sh
   ```
